For this assignment, I built a web app using HTML and Flask that takes a date as a user input and gets the NBA standings for each/both conferences for that day. This part of the project can be found starting in line 54. This can be run via `python SI364W18_HW1 runserver` and accessed through your local server at `/problem4form`
